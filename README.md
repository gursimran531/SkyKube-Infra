# ðŸŒŒ SkyKube - Cloud-Native Voice Notes Platform

**SkyKube** is a cloud-native project designed to demonstrate end-to-end DevOps practices using **AWS, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD automation**.  
The project is divided into two repositories:  

- **[SkyKube-Infra](https://github.com/gursimran531/SkyKube-Infra.git)** â€” Contains all Infrastructure as Code (IaC) components built with Terraform (VPC, EKS, ECR, S3, Lambda, Route 53, CloudFront, IAM, etc.).  
- **[SkyKube-App](https://github.com/gursimran531/SkyKube-App.git)** â€” Contains the application source code, Kubernetes manifests, and GitHub Actions workflow for automated CI/CD deployment to AWS EKS.

# SkyKube Infrastructure

This repository contains the **infrastructure code** for the SkyKube project using **Terraform**. The infrastructure includes all cloud resources required to deploy the SkyKube application.

> **Note:** SkyKube application code is maintained in a separate repository: [SkyKube-App](https://github.com/gursimran531/SkyKube-App.git)

## Architecture Overview

The SkyKube infrastructure is designed to be **secure, scalable, and modular**. The main components are:

- **VPC & Subnets**
  - Public subnets: For Load Balancer, NAT gateways (if needed)
  - Private subnets: For EKS nodes, RDS, and other internal resources

- **EKS Cluster**
  - Private node groups deployed across multiple availability zones
  - Helm used to install the **AWS Load Balancer Controller**
  - Supports Kubernetes deployments from GitHub Actions

- **IAM Roles**
  - Roles for EKS, Lambda, and other AWS services with least privilege policies

- **ECR**
  - Container registry for application images
  - Scan-on-push enabled for security

- **Lambda & API Gateway**
  - Serverless backend for the application
  - Lambda functions handle voice note processing
  - API Gateway provides HTTP endpoints

- **S3**
  - Storage for voice notes
  - Presigned URLs used for secure access

- **CloudFront & Route 53**
  - CloudFront CDN in front of ALB and API Gateway
  - Custom domain managed via Route 53
  - Provides HTTPS termination and caching

- **CloudWatch**
  - Logging and monitoring for EKS, Lambda, and other AWS resources

## Issues Faced

During the setup, some challenges were encountered:

1. **AWS Load Balancer Controller installation**
   - Initially faced issues with IAM permissions for the controller
   - Cluster roles and service account needed precise configuration
   - Helm installation required careful namespace and version management

2. **Ingress vs Load Balancer**
   - Using an **Ingress** with AWS LB Controller provides:
     - Single entry point with path-based routing
     - TLS termination at ingress level for secure traffic
     - Better cost optimization compared to creating multiple Load Balancers
   - Direct LoadBalancer service per app can increase cost and exposes multiple endpoints, reducing centralized security control

---

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform
- **Modular architecture** for VPC, EKS, IAM, Lambda, and networking
- **Least privilege IAM roles** for all services
- **Multi-AZ deployment** for high availability
- **Automatic deployments** via GitHub Actions workflows
- **CloudFront in front of public endpoints** for secure and fast access
- **Presigned URLs** for S3 access instead of public buckets
- **CloudWatch logging and metrics** enabled for observability
- **ECR scan-on-push** to ensure container security

## Deployment

1. Configure your **AWS CLI** credentials.
2. Initialize Terraform modules:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
3. Validate configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```
4. Plan changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   ```
5. Apply infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply tfplan
   ```

## Notes

- CloudFront provides SSL/TLS termination, caching, and CDN benefits.
- Lambda and API Gateway are fully serverless for backend processing.
- Security is layered: VPC subnets, IAM roles, CloudFront, and presigned URLs.

- Once the infrastructure is created, youâ€™ll need to deploy the application so that the ALB (Application Load Balancer) is provisioned. After that, you can use the ALBâ€™s DNS name when setting up CloudFront to ensure proper routing. I also encountered a few issues related to security group configurations during this process that I had to manually allow traffic from alb sg to node group sg â€” any suggestions or improvements would be greatly appreciated.
